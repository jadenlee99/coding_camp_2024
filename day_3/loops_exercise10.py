Because I am sad, it is very difficult to open the doorknob and leave my house.
Some people tell me taht the solution is to just concentrate and I will stop
being sad, but they are clearly spouting nonsense. At least when my close
friends found that I am sad, they just accepted it and have been there for me
to help me get out of the house. Maybe one day I will be able to stop being
sad and be more open about it.
